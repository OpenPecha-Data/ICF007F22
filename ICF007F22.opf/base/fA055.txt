Prayer for the Swift Rebirth of Jamyang Khyentse Wangpo
by Jamgön Kongtrul Lodrö Thayé

jampé yang sok sé ché gyal kün gyi
Single embodiment of the knowledge, love and power
khyen tsé nü pé yeshe chikdü pa
Of Mañjughoṣa and the rest—all the Victors and their heirs.
khedrub wangpo palden lama la
Master of the learned and accomplished, glorious guru,
nying né solwa deb so tukjé zung
To you I offer heartfelt prayer: hold me in your compassion.

chö kyi ying lé trulpé kur zheng nam
May those arising as nirmāṇakāya from the dharma-sphere
barché dü kyi yul lé nampar gyal
Gain total victory in the battle over obstacles and māras.
dorjé sum gyi ngowor tsozhé né
May they abide within the very essence of the three vajras
ten drö dön chen drubpar dzé du sol
And bring magnificent benefit to the teachings and to beings.

Lodrö Tayé added a verse for swift rebirth to the first stanza containing the master’s own words.
May it prove virtuous!
