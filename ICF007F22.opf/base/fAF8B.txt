Prayer to Orgyen Jigme Chökyi Wangpo1
by Jamgön Kongtrul Lodrö Thayé

kyé tob khyen rab namkhé khyön tar yang
The wisdom you acquired at birth is as vast as space itself,
labpa sum gyi jang yön ta ru chin
And you perfected the qualities of the threefold training.
dreltsé gyalsé chöpar juk dzepa
You who introduce all with whom you’re connected to bodhisattva activity,
orgyen jikme chökyi wangpo la
Orgyen Jigme Chökyi Wangpo,
solwa deb so jingyi lab tu sol
To you I pray: inspire me with your blessings.

May it be virtuous!
