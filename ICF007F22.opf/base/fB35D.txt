Prayer to Jamgön Kongtrul Lodrö Thayé1
by Jamgön Kongtrul Lodrö Thayé

kyé chen yongdzin dumé jesu zung
You were guided by numerous great beings as your teachers,
rimé gyalten kün la khyenpa gyé
And your knowledge of all the nonsectarian teachings of the Victorious Ones blossomed,
sumden dorjé dzin chok rik kyi dak
Supreme Vajra-holder of the threefold vows, lord of my buddha family—
lodrö tayé zhab la solwa deb
Lodrö Thayé, at your feet I pray.

The master himself spoke these words at the request of Gelong Tsoknyi Dorje while in Ri Gyal
Dzong. May virtue and excellence increase.
